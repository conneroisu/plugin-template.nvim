# plugin-template.nvim

[![Integration][integration-badge]][integration-runs]

A template to create Neovim plugins written in [Lua][lua].

## Using

Clone/download it locally and change the references to `my_awesome_plugin`, 
`my_cool_module` accordingly to your new plugin name. Don't forget to edit the
[help][help] file accordingly.

### Development Environment

This project supports development with Nix Flake for a consistent, reproducible development environment.

#### Using Nix (Recommended)

If you have Nix with flakes enabled:

```bash
# Enter the development shell
nix develop

# Or with direnv installed
direnv allow
```

The Nix development shell provides:
- Lua and LuaRocks
- Lua Language Server (lua-language-server)
- Code formatters (stylua, alejandra)
- Linters (luacheck via luarocks, statix, deadnix)
- YAML tools (yaml-language-server, actionlint)
- Custom command `dx` to edit the flake.nix

#### Manual Setup

If not using Nix, you'll need to manually install:
- [Lua][lua] and [LuaRocks][luarocks] to run the linter

## Testing

This uses [busted][busted], [luassert][luassert] (both through
[plenary.nvim][plenary]) and [matcher_combinators][matcher_combinators] to
define tests in `test/spec/` directory. These dependencies are required only to
run tests, that's why they are installed as git submodules.

Make sure your shell is in the `./test` directory or, if it is in the root directory,
replace `make` by `make -C ./test` in the commands below.

To init the dependencies run

```bash
$ make prepare
```

To run all tests just execute

```bash
$ make test
```

If you have [entr(1)][entr] installed you may use it to run all tests whenever a
file is changed using:

```bash
$ make watch
```

In both commands you myght specify a single spec to test/watch using:

```bash
$ make test SPEC=spec/my_awesome_plugin/my_cool_module_spec.lua
$ make watch SPEC=spec/my_awesome_plugin/my_cool_module_spec.lua
```

## Github actions

An Action will run all the tests and the linter on every commit on the main
branch and also on Pull Request. Tests will be run using 
[stable and nightly][neovim-test-versions] versions of Neovim.
